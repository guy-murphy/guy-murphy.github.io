<p>I first started learning to program Pascal on a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_Machines_380Z" target="_blank" rel="external">Research Machine 380Z</a>. There’s not getting away from feeling old when you talk about using pre-DOS CP/M systems. This was around 1983, when having dual floppy-disks and amber monitor was hardcore. </p>
<p>My first computer of my own was a ZX Spectrum. I still remember how that computer smelt when I first unwrapped it. It smelt like awesome.</p>
<p>Much as I loved learning to program I also loved the theatre which was a darn site sexier for a young man, so I went on to study theatre and then work through my twenties backstage as stage-crew. During this time I kept my hand in as a hobbyist, teaching myself C/C++, and in my later twenties playing about with Linux. I had no idea what to actually do with a computer, what I could build, and nobody to ask. </p>
<p>In the mid-90s the pre-internet online scene was starting to buzz. I’d bought my first IBM PC Compatible, it was a 386SX with SVGA monitor. It was a big boys machine. I got myself a modem, and a Compuserve account. For a lad raised in the Southwest of England, this was something straight out of scifi. Silly phone bills were soon racked up.</p>
<p>Then it all happened very fast, and life changed quite markedly.</p>
<p>Demon Internet rolled out a public service, and Compuserve like a gateway drug quickly progressed to an Internet account. Dialing into London long-distance made the phone bills even sillier, but the first times I used Gopher and IRC was like smelling that ZX Spectrum. I didn’t fully understand what was going on, but it was undeniably awesome.</p>
<p>Then the Web hit at the end of the 90s. Web design, and markup. That wasn’t C++ and databases, I could do that, and because the paint wasn’t even dry on it commercially there weren’t a whole lot of people around who could. In ‘98 I left theatre and set up my own Web-design company with two friends and built my first Web site. It became clear to me before long that the place where it was all happening was London, not the SW of England, and so in ‘99 I moved to London and got my first proper job as a Web-designer.</p>
